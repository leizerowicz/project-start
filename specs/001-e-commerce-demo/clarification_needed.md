# Clarifications Needed - E-commerce Demo

## Areas Requiring Further Specification

This document tracks areas that need additional clarification before proceeding to Step 2 implementation planning.

## High Priority Clarifications

### 1. User Personas and Workflows
**Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
**Question**: Who are the specific user personas and what are their detailed workflows?  
**Current Information**: Artisans, small business owners, and customers looking for unique items  
**Needed**: Detailed user personas with specific use cases and workflow diagrams  
**Impact on Step 2**: Affects SPARC specification detail and technical implementation approach

### 2. Performance and Scalability Requirements  
**Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
**Question**: What are the specific performance and scalability targets?  
**Current Information**: General performance expectations noted  
**Needed**: Specific metrics for response times, concurrent users, data volume, transaction throughput  
**Impact on Step 2**: Affects architecture decisions and technology selection validation

### 3. Integration Requirements
**Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
**Question**: What external systems, APIs, or services need integration?  
**Current Information**: Some constraints noted: PCI compliance, payment processing integrations  
**Needed**: Detailed integration requirements, data formats, security requirements  
**Impact on Step 2**: Affects API design and data architecture planning

## Medium Priority Clarifications

### 4. User Experience and Design Requirements
**Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
**Question**: What are the specific UX/UI requirements and design constraints?  
**Current Information**: General usability requirements noted  
**Needed**: Design system requirements, accessibility standards, mobile responsiveness details  
**Impact on Step 2**: Affects frontend architecture and component design

### 5. Data Requirements and Privacy
**Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
**Question**: What specific data is collected, processed, and stored?  
**Current Information**: Compliance needs: PCI DSS compliance for payments  
**Needed**: Detailed data model, privacy requirements, data retention policies  
**Impact on Step 2**: Affects database design and security implementation

### 6. Business Logic and Rules  
**Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
**Question**: What are the specific business rules and logic requirements?  
**Current Information**: Increase artisan income and customer satisfaction  
**Needed**: Detailed business rules, validation logic, workflow automation requirements  
**Impact on Step 2**: Affects service layer design and business logic implementation

## Low Priority Clarifications

### 7. Deployment and Infrastructure Preferences
**Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
**Question**: What are the preferred deployment targets and infrastructure constraints?  
**Current Information**: Architecture style selected (Microservices (distributed services))  
**Needed**: Cloud provider preferences, infrastructure requirements, deployment automation needs  
**Impact on Step 2**: Affects deployment planning and infrastructure architecture

### 8. Monitoring and Analytics Requirements
**Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
**Question**: What monitoring, analytics, and observability requirements exist?  
**Current Information**: Success metrics: Sales volume, user retention, artisan success rates  
**Needed**: Specific monitoring requirements, analytics needs, alerting preferences  
**Impact on Step 2**: Affects monitoring architecture and instrumentation planning

### 9. Maintenance and Support Model
**Status**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
**Question**: What are the long-term maintenance and support requirements?  
**Current Information**: Team size: 3  
**Needed**: Support model, maintenance procedures, documentation requirements  
**Impact on Step 2**: Affects code organization and documentation strategy

## Special Considerations

### Project-Specific Considerations: Need multi-language support and payment gateway integrations

## Clarification Resolution Process

### For High Priority Items:
1. **Schedule stakeholder meetings** within 3-5 business days
2. **Document detailed requirements** with acceptance criteria  
3. **Update constitutional memory** with clarified requirements
4. **Proceed to Step 2** only after high priority items are resolved

### For Medium Priority Items:
1. **Address during Step 2 planning** as part of SPARC methodology
2. **Create research tasks** in Step 2 implementation planning
3. **Include in constitutional validation gates** for Step 2

### For Low Priority Items:  
1. **Document assumptions** for initial implementation
2. **Plan for iteration** in later development phases
3. **Include in technical debt tracking** for future refinement

## Constitutional Compliance Notes

### Article IV: Specification-Driven Implementation
These clarifications ensure that implementation will be driven by complete, executable specifications rather than assumptions.

### Article III: Constitutional Compliance  
All clarifications must be resolved with testable, unambiguous specifications before implementation begins.

### Article IX: Continuous Validation
Clarification resolution will be validated through constitutional gates in Step 2 planning.

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Before Step 2):
- [ ] Schedule clarification meetings with stakeholders  
- [ ] Prioritize high-priority clarifications for resolution
- [ ] Update project memory with clarified requirements

### Step 2 Integration:
- [ ] Incorporate clarified requirements into SPARC methodology
- [ ] Validate technical approach against clarified requirements  
- [ ] Update constitutional validation gates with specific criteria

### Ongoing:
- [ ] Track clarification resolution in project memory
- [ ] Update constitutional memory with patterns for future projects
- [ ] Monitor for new clarifications during implementation
