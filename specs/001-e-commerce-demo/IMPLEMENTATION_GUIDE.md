# E-commerce Demo - Implementation Guide

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
Node.js (Express) + React + MongoDB


**Constitutional Justification**: Technology choices align with Article VII (Simplicity) and avoid over-engineering while meeting project requirements.

### Architecture Style
**Selected Approach**: Microservices (distributed services)

**Rationale**: 
- Aligns with project scale and team size (3)
- Supports expected growth and complexity
- Balances development speed with maintainability

### Development Phases and Milestones

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Step 1 completion with constitutional framework
- [ ] Development environment setup
- [ ] Core architecture implementation
- [ ] Basic authentication and user management

**Constitutional Gates:**
- [ ] Architecture follows simplicity principles
- [ ] Test framework established (Article VIII)
- [ ] Code quality standards defined

#### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-6)
**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Primary user workflows implementation
- [ ] Data management functionality
- [ ] Basic UI/UX implementation
- [ ] Integration testing framework

**Constitutional Gates:**
- [ ] All features have corresponding tests
- [ ] User stories trace to implementation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-10)
**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Advanced feature implementation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Documentation completion

**Constitutional Gates:**
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage achieved
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Security audit passed

#### Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring (Weeks 11-12)
**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Production deployment setup
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configuration
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Go-live preparation

**Constitutional Gates:**
- [ ] All quality gates passed
- [ ] Deployment automation tested
- [ ] Rollback procedures verified

## Development Team Structure

### Team Size: 3

### Agent Coordination Level: Advanced (multiple agents with complex coordination)

### Recommended Roles:
- **Project Lead**: Overall coordination and architecture decisions
- **Backend Developer**: API and data layer implementation
- **Frontend Developer**: User interface and experience
- **DevOps Engineer**: Infrastructure and deployment (if team size permits)
- **QA Engineer**: Testing and quality assurance

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Testing Strategy: Unit + Integration + E2E tests

### Quality Requirements:
High performance, mobile-responsive, accessibility compliant

### Constitutional Compliance:
- **Article III**: All implementations must pass constitutional validation
- **Article VIII**: Test-first development (NON-NEGOTIABLE) 
- **Article IX**: Continuous validation at every workflow transition

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks:
- **Architecture Complexity**: Mitigate through incremental development
- **Technology Learning Curve**: Provide training and documentation
- **Integration Challenges**: Plan integration points early

### Project Risks:
- **Timeline Pressure**: Maintain quality through constitutional gates
- **Scope Creep**: Regular stakeholder alignment on priorities
- **Resource Constraints**: Plan minimum viable product (MVP) first

### Specific Constraints: PCI compliance, payment processing integrations

## Performance Targets

### Response Time
- Page load: < 3 seconds
- API responses: < 1 second
- Database queries: < 500ms

### Scalability
- Concurrent users: Based on Artisans, small business owners, and customers looking for unique items
- Data volume: Plan for 10x growth
- Transaction volume: Design for peak load scenarios

### Availability
- Uptime target: 99.9%
- Recovery time: < 15 minutes
- Backup frequency: Daily with point-in-time recovery

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Setup
- **Development**: Local development environment
- **Staging**: Pre-production testing environment  
- **Production**: Live production environment

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing on every commit
- Automated deployment to staging
- Manual approval for production deployment
- Automated rollback capabilities

### Monitoring and Observability
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- User behavior analytics
- Infrastructure monitoring
