./cli/enhance-step-1 "Project Name"             # Interactive discovery process

# Placeholder commands (structure ready):
./cli/enhance-step-2 --project-path <path>      # Coming next
./cli/enhance-step-3                            # Coming next  
./cli/enhance-step-4                            # Coming next
```

- Development approach (Agile, TDD, BDD, DDD, rapid prototyping)

### ✅ Quality & Compliance
- Quality requirements specification
- Regulatory compliance needs (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Testing strategy preferences

### ✅ Project Constraints
- Timeline and deadline requirements
- Budget and resource constraints
- Technical limitations and considerations

### ✅ Agent Coordination
- Multi-agent coordination level preferences
- Team size and collaboration approach
- Special project considerations

## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED & CONTEXT FOR CONTINUATION

### What Works Well
1. **Interactive Questionnaire Approach** - Users appreciate guided discovery
2. **Constitutional Integration** - Quality gates catch issues early
3. **Memory System Design** - Context preservation eliminates repetition
4. **Modular CLI Architecture** - Easy to extend with additional commands

### Technical Patterns Established
1. **Python-based CLI** with robust argument parsing and error handling
2. **Template-driven document generation** with dynamic content insertion
3. **JSON-based project info storage** for easy data management
4. **Shell wrapper scripts** for user-friendly command execution

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Project numbering system** (001, 002, etc.) for organization
2. **Specs directory structure** with subdirectories for different phases
3. **Memory directory separation** for different types of persistent context
4. **Constitutional validation as separate document** for clear compliance tracking

### Ready for Next Developer
- **All code is documented** with clear function names and comments
- **Project structure is established** with consistent patterns
- **CLI architecture is extensible** - just add new commands to main() function
- **Template system is reusable** - follow existing patterns for Steps 2-4
- **Memory system integration points** are clearly defined
