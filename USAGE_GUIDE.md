# Project-Start Enhanced: Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Interactive CLI Now Available!

The SPEC_KIT_INTEGRATION_PLAN has been implemented with a fully functional interactive CLI that asks questions to understand your project plans and generates comprehensive specifications automatically.

## ⚡ Quick Start (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Complete Interactive Setup
```bash
cd /path/to/project-start
./cli/enhance-step-1 "My Project Name"
```

This will:
1. **Ask comprehensive questions** about your project, technology preferences, team size, timeline, etc.
2. **Generate 6 complete documents** with constitutional compliance
3. **Initialize persistent memory** for future agent interactions
4. **Provide next steps** for continuing to Step 2

### Option 2: Quick Setup with Defaults  
```bash
cd /path/to/project-start
./cli/project-start-enhanced "Build a task management system with real-time collaboration"
```

Uses sensible defaults but you can customize by using Option 1.

## 📋 What Questions Does It Ask?

The interactive CLI guides you through:

### Basic Project Information
- Project name and description
- Target audience and users
- Business value and success metrics

### Technical Preferences
- **Technology Stack**: Choose from 7 popular stacks or specify custom
  - Python (FastAPI/Django) + React + PostgreSQL
  - Node.js (Express) + React + MongoDB  
  - Java (Spring Boot) + Angular + MySQL
  - C# (.NET Core) + React + SQL Server
  - Go + Vue.js + PostgreSQL
  - PHP (Laravel) + Vue.js + MySQL
  - Custom/Other

- **Architecture Style**: 
  - Monolithic (single deployable unit)
  - Microservices (distributed services)
  - Serverless (functions-as-a-service)  
  - Hybrid (mixed approach)

- **Development Approach**:
  - Agile/Scrum (iterative development)
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD)
  - Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
  - Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
  - Rapid prototyping

### Project Context
- Team size and coordination needs
- Quality and compliance requirements
- Timeline and budget constraints
- Special considerations

## 📄 What Documents Get Generated?

After answering the questions, you get 6 comprehensive documents:

### 1. BACKLOG.md
- **Epic features** with user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Non-functional requirements** (performance, security, usability)
- **Constitutional compliance checklist**
- **Priority ordering** for development

### 2. IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md  
- **Technical architecture** with constitutional justification
- **Development phases** aligned with Project-Start workflow
- **Team structure** and role recommendations
- **Quality assurance strategy** with test-first mandates

### 3. RISK_ASSESSMENT.md
- **Comprehensive risk analysis** (high, medium, low priority)
- **Constitutional mitigation strategies** for each risk
- **Risk monitoring and review procedures**
- **Success metrics** for risk management

### 4. FILE_OUTLINE.md
- **Complete project structure** based on your technology stack
- **File organization** supporting your architecture choice
- **Constitutional compliance** integrated into file structure
- **Development phase evolution** guide

### 5. constitutional_validation.md
- **Step 1 compliance verification** against all 9 constitutional articles
- **Quality assurance checklist** completed
- **Ready for Step 2 confirmation** with next steps
- **Persistent context status** tracking

### 6. clarification_needed.md
- **Areas requiring stakeholder input** before Step 2
- **Prioritized clarifications** (high, medium, low priority)
- **Resolution process** for each clarification type
- **Constitutional compliance notes** for specification completion

## 🧠 Persistent Memory System

The CLI automatically creates and updates:

### memory/project_memory.md
- Current project state and decisions
- Key context for future agent interactions
- Constitutional compliance status tracking
- Next steps and continuation points

### memory/constitutional_memory.md  
- Organizational learning patterns
- Compliance metrics tracking
- Successful implementation patterns
- Lessons learned integration

## 🏗️ Project Structure Created

```
specs/001-your-project/
├── BACKLOG.md
├── IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
├── RISK_ASSESSMENT.md
├── FILE_OUTLINE.md
├── constitutional_validation.md
├── clarification_needed.md
├── sparc/ (ready for Step 2)
└── implementation_details/ (ready for Step 2)
```

## ✅ Constitutional Compliance Built-In

Every generated document includes:
- **Article III compliance**: All specifications are testable and unambiguous
- **Article VIII compliance**: Test-first development mandates (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **Article VII compliance**: Simplicity principle in all technical decisions
- **All 9 articles validated** with specific evidence and next steps

## 🔄 Next Steps After Step 1

Once Step 1 completes, you'll see:
```
🎉 ENHANCED STEP 1 COMPLETED!

📂 Project Path: /path/to/specs/001-your-project
📋 Spec-Kit Integration Status: ✓ ACTIVE
📋 Constitutional Validation: ✓ PASSED  
📋 Memory Systems: ✓ INITIALIZED

🔄 Next: /enhance-step-2 --project-path /path/to/specs/001-your-project
```

## 🚧 Coming Next: Steps 2-4

The CLI structure is ready for:
- **Step 2**: Constitutional SPARC methodology implementation
- **Step 3**: Advanced persistent context systems  
- **Step 4**: Constitutional PACT framework with multi-agent coordination

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Before Running
- **Think about your project** - have a clear idea of what you want to build
- **Consider your constraints** - timeline, budget, team size, compliance needs
- **Know your preferences** - technology stack, architecture style, development approach

### During the Interview
- **Be specific** - detailed answers generate better specifications
- **Use defaults when uncertain** - you can always refine later
- **Consider constitutional principles** - simplicity, test-first, specification-driven

### After Generation  
- **Review all documents** - ensure they match your vision
- **Address clarifications** - work with stakeholders on unclear areas
- **Validate technical approach** - confirm technology choices with team

## 🎯 Example Session

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### CLI Not Found
```bash
# Make sure scripts are executable
chmod +x ./cli/*

# Run directly with Python if needed
python3 ./cli/project_start_cli.py /enhance-step-1 "Project Name"
```

### Python Dependencies
```bash
# The CLI uses only Python standard library - no additional packages needed
python3 --version  # Requires Python 3.6+
```

### Questions Too Fast
- Take your time - there's no rush
- Use defaults when unsure - you can always refine  
- Press Ctrl+C to exit and restart if needed

## 📞 Getting Help
