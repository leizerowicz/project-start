# PACT Framework: Agentic Software Engineering Guide

## Overview for AI Agents

This document provides comprehensive instructions for implementing the PACT (Planning, Action, Coordination, Testing) framework specifically designed for agentic software engineering. PACT complements and extends the SPARC methodology by focusing on multi-agent coordination, autonomous decision-making, and collaborative development processes.

## What is PACT?

PACT (Planning, Action, Coordination, Testing) is a specialized framework that addresses the unique challenges of agentic software development where multiple AI agents work together to build, maintain, and evolve software systems. Unlike traditional development methodologies, PACT emphasizes agent autonomy, collaborative intelligence, and adaptive coordination.

**Core Flow**: P → A → C → T (Planning → Action → Coordination → Testing)

**Integration with SPARC**: PACT phases can be applied within each SPARC phase or as a meta-framework that guides how agents collaborate throughout the SPARC process.

## Key Principles for Agentic Development

1. **Autonomous Agent Operation**: Each agent operates independently within defined boundaries
2. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Agents share knowledge and coordinate decisions effectively  
3. **Adaptive Coordination**: Coordination mechanisms adapt to project complexity and team dynamics
4. **Continuous Validation**: Testing and validation occur throughout all phases, not just at the end
5. **Emergent Architecture**: System architecture emerges from agent interactions and decisions
6. **Context-Aware Communication**: Agents communicate with full awareness of project context and constraints
7. **Iterative Refinement**: All phases support continuous improvement and learning

## PACT-SPARC Integration Guide

### Integration Patterns

#### 1. PACT as Meta-Framework
Apply PACT phases to coordinate how agents work together throughout the entire SPARC process:
- **Planning**: How agents will collaborate on each SPARC phase
- **Action**: Agent coordination during SPARC phase execution
- **Coordination**: Integration of agent contributions within SPARC phases
- **Testing**: Validation of both SPARC deliverables and agent coordination

#### 2. PACT within SPARC Phases
Apply PACT principles within individual SPARC phases:
- **SPARC Specification + PACT**: Collaborative requirements gathering
- **SPARC Pseudocode + PACT**: Coordinated algorithm design
- **SPARC Architecture + PACT**: Collaborative system design
- **SPARC Refinement + PACT**: Coordinated code quality improvement
- **SPARC Completion + PACT**: Collaborative deployment and maintenance

#### 3. Hybrid PACT-SPARC Methodology
Create a unified methodology that combines both frameworks:
1. **PACT Planning** → **SPARC Specification** (Coordinated requirements)
2. **PACT Action** → **SPARC Pseudocode** (Collaborative algorithm design)
3. **PACT Coordination** → **SPARC Architecture** (Integrated system design)
4. **PACT Testing** → **SPARC Refinement** (Collaborative quality assurance)
5. **PACT Meta-Testing** → **SPARC Completion** (System-wide validation)

## Agent Prompt Templates

### General PACT Implementation Prompt
```
I need you to act as a PACT framework expert and create a [PHASE] document for [PROJECT_DESCRIPTION] in an agentic development environment.

**IMPORTANT: Before proceeding with documentation, you MUST first check for existing project documents and ask the user clarifying questions to understand the multi-agent context.**

Follow this process:
1. **CHECK FOR EXISTING DOCUMENTS**: Look for Phase 1 documents (BACKLOG.md, IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md, RISK_ASSESSMENT.md, FILE_OUTLINE.md) and any existing SPARC documents
2. **ASK THE USER**: Review the project and ask specific questions about:
   - Whether existing documents are current and should inform agent coordination
   - How many agents will be involved and their roles
   - What types of coordination challenges are expected
   - What shared resources or dependencies exist
   - What level of autonomy each agent should have
3. **WAIT FOR RESPONSES**: Do not proceed until the user provides agent-specific information
4. **VALIDATE UNDERSTANDING**: Summarize the multi-agent environment and existing documentation context, confirm it's correct

Then follow the PACT [PHASE] template exactly, ensuring you:
1. **Build on Existing Documentation**: Use Phase 1 documents and existing SPARC documents to inform coordination strategy
2. Design for agent autonomy while maintaining coordination
3. Include specific agent coordination mechanisms
4. Address multi-agent communication and decision-making
5. Consider emergent behaviors and adaptive systems
6. Include comprehensive validation of agent coordination
7. Provide actionable coordination strategies
8. Include thorough reflection on agent collaboration

Output should be a complete markdown document ready for multi-agent implementation.
```

### Phase-Specific PACT Prompts

**Planning Phase**: "Create a comprehensive PACT Planning document for [PROJECT]. FIRST, ask the user about the number of agents, their intended roles, expected coordination challenges, shared resources, and autonomy levels. Wait for their responses. Then design agent ecosystem, task decomposition, coordination protocols, and resource management strategies. Focus on establishing effective multi-agent collaboration from the start."

**Action Phase**: "Develop a PACT Action execution plan for [PROJECT]. FIRST, ask the user about execution priorities, real-time coordination needs, quality gates, and emergency procedures. Wait for their responses. Then create execution strategies, real-time coordination mechanisms, quality assurance during execution, and progress monitoring systems. Emphasize maintaining agent autonomy while ensuring collaborative effectiveness."

**Coordination Phase**: "Design a PACT Coordination optimization plan for [PROJECT]. FIRST, ask the user about integration challenges, communication bottlenecks, consistency requirements, and learning objectives. Wait for their responses. Then develop integration strategies, collaboration optimization, system coherence validation, and collective intelligence mechanisms. Focus on enhancing agent collaboration and system integration."

**Testing Phase**: "Create a comprehensive PACT Testing strategy for [PROJECT]. FIRST, ask the user about testing priorities, validation requirements, performance expectations, and quality metrics. Wait for their responses. Then develop multi-agent testing strategies, validation frameworks, test automation, and quality metrics. Ensure both individual agent and collaborative system behavior are thoroughly validated."

## Best Practices for Agentic Development

### Communication Best Practices
1. **Clear Communication Protocols**: Establish standardized formats for agent communication
2. **Context Sharing**: Ensure agents have access to necessary project context
3. **Status Broadcasting**: Implement regular status updates between agents
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Define clear procedures for handling disagreements

### Coordination Best Practices
1. **Loose Coupling**: Design agent interactions to minimize dependencies
2. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning if individual agents fail
3. **Load Balancing**: Distribute work evenly among available agents
4. **Adaptive Allocation**: Dynamically reassign tasks based on agent capabilities

### Quality Assurance Best Practices
1. **Continuous Validation**: Validate work products continuously, not just at checkpoints
2. **Peer Review**: Implement agent peer review mechanisms
3. **Automated Testing**: Use automated testing for rapid validation
4. **Quality Metrics**: Track both individual and collaborative quality metrics

### Documentation Best Practices
1. **Living Documentation**: Keep documentation updated automatically
2. **Multi-Agent Authoring**: Allow multiple agents to contribute to documentation
3. **Version Synchronization**: Keep all documentation versions synchronized
4. **Context Preservation**: Maintain full context for all decisions and changes

## Reflection and Evolution

The PACT framework is designed to evolve with your project and agent ecosystem. Regular reflection on coordination effectiveness, communication quality, and collaborative outcomes helps refine and improve the framework application. Consider the framework as a living system that grows and adapts to your specific agentic development needs.

Remember: Successful agentic development requires balancing agent autonomy with collaborative effectiveness. The PACT framework provides the structure to achieve this balance systematically and consistently.
