# PACT-SPARC Integration Guide: Unified Agentic Development Framework

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance for integrating the PACT (Planning, Action, Coordination, Testing) framework with the SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology to create a unified approach for agentic software development.

## Integration Philosophy

The integration of PACT and SPARC creates a powerful methodology that combines:
- **SPARC's systematic development phases** with **PACT's multi-agent coordination**
- **Individual agent autonomy** with **collaborative system building**
- **Structured problem-solving** with **adaptive coordination**

## Integration Models

### Model 1: PACT as Meta-Framework (Recommended)
Apply PACT phases to coordinate agent collaboration throughout the entire SPARC process:

```
PACT Planning → [SPARC S-P-A-R-C with coordinated agents] → PACT Testing
```

**When to Use**: Complex projects with multiple specialized agents
**Benefits**: Maximum coordination while preserving SPARC structure
**Complexity**: Medium

### Model 2: PACT Within SPARC Phases
Apply PACT principles within individual SPARC phases:

```
SPARC-S + PACT → SPARC-P + PACT → SPARC-A + PACT → SPARC-R + PACT → SPARC-C + PACT
```

**When to Use**: Projects where each SPARC phase requires significant agent coordination
**Benefits**: Deep coordination within each development phase
**Complexity**: High

### Model 3: Parallel PACT-SPARC Execution
Run PACT and SPARC processes in parallel with synchronization points:

```
PACT: P ←→ A ←→ C ←→ T
      ↕    ↕    ↕    ↕
SPARC: S → P → A → R → C
```

**When to Use**: Projects with ongoing coordination needs alongside development phases
**Benefits**: Continuous coordination with structured development
**Complexity**: High
