|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| [Agent 1]     | -         | [Type]    | [Type]    | [Type]    |
| [Agent 2]     | [Type]    | -         | [Type]    | [Type]    |
| [Agent 3]     | [Type]    | [Type]    | -         | [Type]    |
| [Agent N]     | [Type]    | [Type]    | [Type]    | -         |

**Interaction Types:**
- **Direct**: Agents communicate directly
- **Mediated**: Communication through coordination system
- **Broadcast**: One-to-many communication
- **None**: No direct communication needed

## Swarm Topology Design

### Topology Selection
Choose the fundamental coordination pattern that defines how agents interact and collaborate:

#### ⭐️ Star Topology
- **Structure**: Single central agent (hub) coordinates all others (spokes)
- **Management**: Hub assigns tasks, aggregates results, and enforces rules
- **Best For**:
  - Small swarms (3-5 agents)
  - Projects requiring strict oversight and control
  - Clear hierarchical decision-making needs
  - Simple coordination requirements
- **Strengths**:
  - Easy to control and monitor
  - Clear accountability and verification
  - Simplified communication patterns
  - Predictable behavior and outcomes
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Central point of failure
  - Hub becomes bottleneck under load
  - Limited scalability
  - Reduced agent autonomy
- **Implementation Pattern**:
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
      Hub[Coordinator Agent] --> A[Agent 1]
      Hub --> B[Agent 2]
      Hub --> C[Agent 3]
      Hub --> D[Agent N]
  ```

#### 🌟 Mesh Topology
- **Structure**: Agents communicate directly with each other in peer-to-peer fashion
- **Management**: Coordination emerges through local exchanges and negotiation
- **Best For**:
  - Medium to large swarms (4-12 agents)
  - Dynamic, adaptive tasks requiring flexibility
  - Distributed problem-solving scenarios
  - High resilience requirements
- **Strengths**:
  - High resilience - no single point of failure
  - Adaptive and self-organizing
  - Scales well with agent count
  - Preserves agent autonomy
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Harder to monitor globally
  - Risk of coordination drift
  - Complex consensus mechanisms needed
  - Potential communication overhead
- **Implementation Pattern**:
  ```mermaid
  graph LR
      A[Agent 1] <--> B[Agent 2]
      A <--> C[Agent 3]
      A <--> D[Agent 4]
      B <--> C
      B <--> D
      C <--> D
  ```

#### 🧠 Hive-Mind Topology
- **Structure**: Agents operate as parts of a collective organism with shared state
- **Management**: Shared memory and global state ensure synchronized behavior
- **Best For**:
  - Complex reasoning and analysis tasks
  - Large swarms (8+ agents) requiring coordination
  - Continuous learning and adaptation scenarios
  - High-level collaborative intelligence needs
- **Strengths**:
  - Emergent collective intelligence
  - High-level coordination capabilities
  - Shared learning and knowledge evolution
  - Sophisticated collaborative problem-solving
- **Weaknesses**:
  - High communication and coordination costs
  - Risk of runaway effects without proper guardrails
  - Complex state management requirements
  - Potential for groupthink behaviors
- **Implementation Pattern**:
  ```mermaid
  graph TB
      SS[Shared State/Memory]
      SS <--> A[Agent 1]
      SS <--> B[Agent 2]
      SS <--> C[Agent 3]
      SS <--> D[Agent N]
      A <--> B
      B <--> C
      C <--> A
  ```

### Hybrid Topology Strategies
Most effective systems layer these patterns based on system demands:

#### Hierarchical Hybrid (Star + Mesh)
- **Structure**: Star topology at high level with mesh clusters
- **Use Case**: Large projects with specialized sub-teams
- **Pattern**: Department/team leads in star, team members in mesh
```mermaid
graph TB
    Coordinator[Central Coordinator]
    Coordinator --> TeamA[Team A Lead]
    Coordinator --> TeamB[Team B Lead]

    subgraph "Team A Mesh"
    TeamA <--> A1[Agent A1]
    TeamA <--> A2[Agent A2]
    A1 <--> A2
    end

    subgraph "Team B Mesh"
    TeamB <--> B1[Agent B1]
    TeamB <--> B2[Agent B2]
    B1 <--> B2
    end
```

#### Dynamic Topology
- **Structure**: Topology changes based on current phase or task requirements
- **Use Case**: Projects with varying coordination needs over time
- **Pattern**: Star for planning, Mesh for execution, Hive-mind for learning
