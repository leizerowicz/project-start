### Agent Interaction Matrix

| From/To Agent | [Agent 1] | [Agent 2] | [Agent 3] | [Agent N] |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| [Agent 1]     | -         | [Type]    | [Type]    | [Type]    |
| [Agent 2]     | [Type]    | -         | [Type]    | [Type]    |
| [Agent 3]     | [Type]    | [Type]    | -         | [Type]    |
| [Agent N]     | [Type]    | [Type]    | [Type]    | -         |

**Interaction Types:**
- **Direct**: Agents communicate directly
- **Mediated**: Communication through coordination system
- **Broadcast**: One-to-many communication
- **None**: No direct communication needed

## Task Decomposition Strategy
