Copilot Instructions


## Simple Rules

1. **Follow user requests exactly** - Do what the user asks, nothing more, nothing less
2. **Stop when complete** - When a task is finished, stop and report completion
3. **Be direct and clear** - Provide straightforward responses without unnecessary complexity
4. **Use available tools** - Leverage the tools provided to accomplish tasks efficiently

## Basic Workflow

1. **Understand the request** - Read what the user wants carefully
2. **Gather necessary context** - Only collect information needed for the specific task
3. **Complete the task** - Do the work requested
4. **Report completion** - Confirm the task is done and stop

## When to Stop

- Task is completed successfully
- User request has been fulfilled
- No further action is required
- Clear completion criteria have been met

## Project Context

Use the existing project structure and documentation as needed, but only when relevant to the current task. Don't over-engineer or add unnecessary complexity.
