# SPARC Methodology Guide

## Overview
SPARC is a structured problem-solving methodology that provides a systematic approach to analyzing, planning, and implementing solutions. This guide helps agents understand and apply the SPARC framework to software development projects.

## SPARC Framework

### S - SPECIFY (Problem Definition)
**Objective**: Clearly define the problem, requirements, and constraints.

**Key Activities**:
- Identify and articulate the core problem
- Define project scope and boundaries  
- Gather and document requirements
- Identify constraints and limitations
- Establish success criteria and metrics

**Questions to Ask**:
- What exactly is the problem we're solving?
- What are the must-have vs. nice-to-have requirements?
- What constraints do we need to work within?
- How will we measure success?
- What assumptions are we making?

**Deliverables**:
- Problem statement
- Requirements specification
- Constraints documentation
- Success metrics definition

### P - PLAN (Solution Design)
**Objective**: Develop a comprehensive solution approach and implementation plan.

**Key Activities**:
- Design system architecture
- Select technology stack and tools
- Create development methodology
- Plan resource allocation
- Establish timeline and milestones
- Design testing strategy

**Questions to Ask**:
- What is the optimal architecture for this solution?
- Which technologies best fit our requirements and constraints?
- How should we structure the development process?
- What resources do we need and when?
- What are the critical path activities?

**Deliverables**:
- Architecture design
- Technology stack selection
- Project timeline
- Resource plan
- Risk mitigation plan

### A - ANALYZE (Risk & Feasibility Assessment)
**Objective**: Evaluate the proposed solution for risks, feasibility, and optimization opportunities.

**Key Activities**:
- Conduct technical feasibility analysis
- Identify and assess risks
- Evaluate resource requirements
- Analyze dependencies
- Review architectural decisions
- Consider alternative approaches

**Questions to Ask**:
- Is this solution technically feasible?
- What are the major risks and how can we mitigate them?
- Do we have the necessary resources and expertise?
- Are there better alternative approaches?
- What dependencies could impact our timeline?

**Deliverables**:
- Feasibility assessment
- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies
- Resource gap analysis
- Alternative solution options
- Dependency mapping

### R - REALIZE (Implementation)
**Objective**: Execute the planned solution with proper monitoring and quality assurance.

**Key Activities**:
- Implement core functionality
- Conduct testing and quality assurance
- Monitor progress against milestones
- Manage changes and adaptations
- Coordinate team activities
- Ensure documentation

**Questions to Ask**:
- Are we meeting our development milestones?
- Is the quality meeting our standards?
- Are we staying within scope and budget?
- What adjustments need to be made?
- Are stakeholders satisfied with progress?

**Deliverables**:
- Working software components
- Test results and quality metrics
- Progress reports
- Updated documentation
- Change management records

### C - COMMUNICATE (Documentation & Knowledge Transfer)
**Objective**: Document the solution and facilitate knowledge transfer to stakeholders.

**Key Activities**:
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Conduct knowledge transfer sessions
- Gather feedback from stakeholders
- Document lessons learned
- Plan maintenance and support
- Establish communication channels

**Questions to Ask**:
- Is our documentation complete and accessible?
- Do stakeholders understand how to use/maintain the solution?
- What feedback have we received and how should we address it?
- What lessons learned should be captured?
- How will ongoing support and communication be handled?

**Deliverables**:
- Technical documentation
- User documentation  
- Training materials
- Lessons learned report
- Support and maintenance plan

## Application to Software Projects

### Phase 1: SPECIFY
Use this phase to work with stakeholders to clearly define the software project requirements, scope, and success criteria. This aligns with Step 1 of the project-start template.

### Phase 2: PLAN
Develop detailed technical plans, architecture designs, and implementation strategies. This builds on the documents from Step 1.

### Phase 3: ANALYZE  
Conduct thorough analysis of the proposed solution, identifying risks and ensuring feasibility before implementation begins.

### Phase 4: REALIZE
Execute the development plan with proper monitoring, testing, and quality assurance practices.

### Phase 5: COMMUNICATE
Ensure proper documentation, knowledge transfer, and ongoing communication strategies are in place.

## Instructions for Agents

When working with users to apply the SPARC methodology:

1. **Sequential Application**: Guide users through each phase in order
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Allow for iteration within phases as new information emerges  
3. **Documentation Focus**: Ensure each phase produces clear, actionable documentation
4. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Regularly validate understanding and decisions with stakeholders
5. **Risk Awareness**: Continuously assess and communicate risks throughout the process

## Integration with Other Steps

- **From Step 1**: Use the project discovery documents as input to the SPECIFY phase
- **To Step 3**: The SPARC analysis provides foundation for creating expert context files
- **Throughout Project**: Return to SPARC phases as needed for major decisions or changes

This methodology ensures systematic, thorough approach to software development that maximizes success probability and minimizes risks.
