# Project Start: Agentic Engineering Framework

A proven 4-step framework for agentic engineering projects with constitutional governance principles and automated specification generation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive project discovery (recommended)
cd project-start
./cli/enhance-step-1 "Your project description"

# Complete 4-step workflow
./cli/enhance-step-2 --project-path specs/001-your-project
./cli/enhance-step-3 --project-path specs/001-your-project
./cli/enhance-step-4 --project-path specs/001-your-project

# Or use master command with defaults
./cli/project-start-enhanced "Your project description"
```

## ✅ Production Ready Features

- **Interactive CLI** with comprehensive questionnaire system
- **Automated document generation** (20+ documents per project)
- **Constitutional compliance** validation from inception
- **4-step development workflow** fully implemented
- **Persistent memory systems** for multi-agent coordination
- **Quality gates** preventing architectural drift
- **Enhanced README reading** - CLI reads from Step 1-4 READMEs for context-aware generation

## 🔧 Enhanced CLI Capabilities

The CLI now reads contextual information from all step README files to generate more comprehensive and accurate documentation:

- **Step 1**: Reads `step_1/README.md` for project discovery context and brutally honest market validation
- **Step 2**: Reads `step_2/sparc_methodology_guide.md` for SPARC methodology principles and implementation guidance  
- **Step 3**: Reads `step_3/README.md` for agentic system integration and expert context
- **Step 4**: Reads `step_4/` templates for PACT framework implementation details

This ensures all generated documents are informed by the complete framework methodology rather than using generic templates.

## 🏗️ Framework Overview

**4-Step Agentic Engineering Workflow:**
- **Step 1**: Discovery & Planning (interactive questionnaire + 6 documents)
- **Step 2**: Constitutional SPARC Methodology (specification-driven development)
- **Step 3**: Persistent Context Systems (multi-agent coordination)
- **Step 4**: Constitutional PACT Framework (testing & deployment)

## 📋 Constitutional Governance

Governed by 9 immutable principles in `PROJECT_START_CONSTITUTION.md`:
- Workflow-First Development & Constitutional Compliance
- Specification-Driven Implementation & Agent Coordination  
- Memory-Driven Context & Simplicity Principle
- Test-First Development & Continuous Validation

## 🎯 Generated Output

Each project creates:
- 6 comprehensive specification documents
- Constitutional compliance validation
- Persistent memory systems
- Multi-agent coordination protocols
- Complete testing & deployment strategies
