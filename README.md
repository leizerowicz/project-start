# Project Start Template for Agentic Engineering

This repository serves as a comprehensive template for agentic engineering projects, providing a structured approach to building projects with AI agents. Each step folder contains the necessary guides and context to help agents understand project requirements and generate appropriate documentation and implementations.

## Overview

This template is designed to facilitate collaboration between humans and AI agents in software development by providing clear context and structured workflows. The template guides agents through four key phases:

1. **Step 1**: Project Discovery & Planning - Understanding the project concept and generating foundational documents
2. **Step 2**: SPARC Methodology Application - Implementing structured problem-solving approach  
3. **Step 3**: Expert Context Generation - Creating specialized knowledge bases for different aspects of the project
4. **Step 4**: PACT Framework Implementation - Multi-agent coordination and agentic software development

## How to Use

Work through each step sequentially, providing the contained documentation to your AI agent to establish proper context for project development. Each step builds upon the previous one to create a comprehensive foundation for successful agentic engineering.

## Structure

- `step_1/` - Project discovery and initial planning documents
- `step_2/` - SPARC methodology guide and implementation
- `step_3/` - Expert context file generation and specialization
- `step_4/` - PACT framework for multi-agent coordination and agentic development
