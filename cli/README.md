# Project-Start Enhanced CLI Commands

This directory contains CLI commands that integrate AI-powered automation with the Project-Start workflow following the **GitHub Spec-Kit pattern** for intelligent document generation.

## ðŸ¤– AI Integration Features

The CLI now supports multiple AI assistants following the GitHub Spec-Kit pattern:

- **ðŸ¤– GitHub Copilot**: Native VS Code integration for intelligent document generation
- **ðŸ§  Claude Code**: Command-line integration with Claude for enhanced specifications  
- **âœ¨ Gemini CLI**: Google Gemini integration for comprehensive project planning
- **ðŸŽ¯ Fallback Generation**: Intelligent templates when AI tools are unavailable

### AI Assistant Selection

```bash
# Use GitHub Copilot (default)
python3 project_start_cli.py start "My Project" --ai copilot

# Use Claude Code
python3 project_start_cli.py start "My Project" --ai claude

# Use Gemini CLI
python3 project_start_cli.py start "My Project" --ai gemini

# Interactive selection
python3 project_start_cli.py start "My Project"
```

## Core Commands

### `/project-start-enhanced`
Master command that orchestrates the entire enhanced workflow from initial idea to deployment-ready system.

```bash
/project-start-enhanced "Build a task management system with real-time collaboration"
```

**What it does**:
1. Runs enhanced Step 1 (automated discovery with constitutional validation)
2. Runs enhanced Step 2 (constitutional SPARC with test-first planning)
3. Runs enhanced Step 3 (persistent context with automated memory)
4. Runs enhanced Step 4 (constitutional PACT with quality gates)

### `/enhance-step-1` 
Applies Spec-Kit's `/specify` automation to Project-Start's discovery phase while generating all required Step 1 documents. **NEW**: Now supports existing projects with established architecture.

#### New Project Mode
```bash
/enhance-step-1 "Real-time chat application with message history and user presence"
```

#### Existing Project Mode
```bash
# Automatically detects existing project structure
/enhance-step-1 "analysis-of-existing-project"

# Force existing project mode
/enhance-step-1 "existing-project" --existing-project
```

**What it does**:
1. **Project Detection**: Scans current directory for existing project indicators (package.json, requirements.txt, README.md, etc.)
2. **Comprehensive File Analysis**: Analyzes all MD files, code files, and configuration files
3. **Smart File Categorization**: Identifies documentation, code, and config files with focus suggestions
4. **Multi-Mode Operation**: 
   - **New Project**: Traditional interactive questionnaire approach
   - **Existing Project**: File analysis with optional supplementary questions
5. **Flexible Analysis Options**:
   - Automatic analysis of suggested files
   - User-selected file focus
   - Hybrid approach with additional context gathering
6. **Constitutional Integration**: Applies validation gates to both new and existing projects
7. **Memory Initialization**: Sets up persistent context for discovered/created projects

**Existing Project Features**:
- Detects 10+ project types (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Rust, etc.)
- Extracts project metadata from package.json, pyproject.toml, README files
- Analyzes documentation patterns and technical keywords
- Provides comprehensive file categorization and suggestions
- Creates Project-Start documentation while preserving original structure
