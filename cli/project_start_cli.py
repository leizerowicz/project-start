**Impact**: Product-market fit failure, wasted development effort, inability to monetize  
**Probability**: High (based on Step 1 honest market validation)  

**Brutally Honest Questions to Address:**
- Would target users pay $X for this solution right now?
- Who would be devastated if this didn't exist?
- What are we afraid to test because we know it might fail?
- Are we solving this because it's important or because it's the only problem we know how to solve?

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Conduct immediate market validation with paying customers
- Test smallest possible version for actual payment willingness
- Identify and interview users who naturally talk about similar solutions
- Validate pain points through direct customer conversations, not surveys
- Set 90-day revenue validation milestone to prove market demand

1. **Address during Step 2 planning** as part of SPARC methodology
2. **Create research tasks** in Step 2 implementation planning
3. **Include in constitutional validation gates** for Step 2

### For Low Priority Items:  
1. **Document assumptions** for initial implementation
2. **Plan for iteration** in later development phases
3. **Include in technical debt tracking** for future refinement

## Constitutional Compliance Notes

### Article IV: Specification-Driven Implementation
These clarifications ensure that implementation will be driven by complete, executable specifications rather than assumptions.

### Article III: Constitutional Compliance  
All clarifications must be resolved with testable, unambiguous specifications before implementation begins.

### Article IX: Continuous Validation
Clarification resolution will be validated through constitutional gates in Step 2 planning.

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Before Step 2):
- [ ] Schedule clarification meetings with stakeholders  
- [ ] Prioritize high-priority clarifications for resolution
- [ ] Update project memory with clarified requirements

### Step 2 Integration:
- [ ] Incorporate clarified requirements into SPARC methodology
- [ ] Validate technical approach against clarified requirements  
- [ ] Update constitutional validation gates with specific criteria

### Ongoing:

**Project Type**: {detection_result['project_type']}

## Analysis Overview

### Files Analyzed
Total files scanned: {len(project_info.get('analyzed_files', []))}

{''.join([f"- {file}\\n" for file in project_info.get('analyzed_files', [])])}

### Key Findings

**Project Name**: {project_info.get('name', 'Unknown')}
**Description**: {project_info.get('description', 'No description available')}

### File Categories Found
- **README files**: {len(detection_result['existing_files']['readme'])}
- **Documentation files**: {len(detection_result['existing_files']['documentation'])}  
- **Code files**: {len(detection_result['existing_files']['code_files'])}
- **Configuration files**: {len(detection_result['existing_files']['config_files'])}
- **Project-Start files**: {len(detection_result['existing_files']['project_start_files'])}

### Extracted Information

{self.format_extracted_info(project_info.get('extracted_info', {}))}

## Recommendations

### Next Steps
1. Review the generated Project-Start documents in this directory
2. Validate the extracted information against your actual project requirements
3. Update any documents that need refinement based on project specifics
4. Run `/enhance-step-2` to continue with the SPARC methodology

### Integration Notes
- The original project structure has been preserved
- Project-Start documents are generated in: `{project_path}`
- You can reference the original files during development
- Consider migrating to the Project-Start structure for better organization

### Constitutional Compliance
- All generated documents follow Project-Start constitutional principles
- Test-first development methodology is recommended for existing code
- Incremental migration to constitutional patterns is suggested

Generated using SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology from Step 2 framework.

### Phase 1 Objectives (from SPARC Guide)
- Create comprehensive specification that serves as project foundation
- Build upon existing Step 1 documents rather than starting from scratch
- Convert backlog items into formal functional requirements
- Include test-driven approach with testing criteria from specification phase
- Ensure sequential development with comprehensive documentation

## Expert Routing System

### Available Expert Files
{chr(10).join(expert_files) if expert_files else "- No expert files found. Run enhance-step-3 to generate expert context files."}

### Expert Routing Logic
**Use this decision tree to determine which expert to consult:**

1. **Architecture & Design Questions** -> `expert_files/architecture_expert.md`
   - System design, component architecture, scalability concerns
   - Integration patterns, service boundaries

2. **Technology Stack Questions** -> `expert_files/tech_stack_expert.md`  
   - Framework selection, library choices, tool configurations
   - Performance optimization, technology-specific patterns

3. **Development Process Questions** -> `expert_files/methodology_expert.md`
   - Testing strategies, deployment processes, development workflows
   - Quality assurance, code review practices

4. **Cross-Domain Questions** -> Consult multiple experts or use coordination commands

### Expert Coordination Commands

#### Workflow State Assessment
```
@copilot assess-workflow-state
```
- Reviews completion status of Steps 1-4
- Identifies workflow dependencies and blockers
- Recommends next actions for workflow progression
- Validates expert system alignment with other steps

1. **Workflow-First**: All work follows Step 1->2->3->4 progression
2. **Persistent Context**: Always consult memory before asking questions
3. **Constitutional Compliance**: Validate all decisions against governance principles
4. **Test-First Development**: Tests before implementation, Red-Green-Refactor
5. **Specification-Driven**: Implementation must trace to specifications
6. **Memory-Driven Context**: Update memory with decisions and lessons learned
7. **Agent Coordination**: Follow multi-agent governance protocols
8. **Simplicity**: Start simple, add complexity only when justified
9. **Continuous Validation**: Quality gates at every transition

## Expert Routing System

### Available Expert Files
{expert_files_list}

### Expert Routing Logic
**Use this decision tree to determine which expert to consult:**

1. **Architecture & Design Questions** -> `expert_files/architecture_expert.md`
   - System design, component architecture, scalability concerns

2. **Technology Stack Questions** -> `expert_files/tech_stack_expert.md`
   - Framework selection, library choices, tool configurations

3. **Development Process Questions** -> `expert_files/methodology_expert.md`
   - Testing strategies, deployment processes, development workflows

### Memory System Integration

#### Before Making ANY Decision - Check Memory Sources:
1. **Project Memory** (`memory/project_memory.md`): Current state, decisions, constraints
2. **Constitutional Memory** (`memory/constitutional_memory.md`): Compliance status, violations
3. **Lesson Memory** (`memory/lesson_memory.md`): Successful patterns, pitfalls

#### After Making Decisions - Update Memory:
- Document decision rationale and constitutional basis
- Update project state and phase progress
- Record lessons learned and pattern recognition
