## Risk Assessment Overview

This document identifies potential risks that could impact project success and outlines mitigation strategies aligned with constitutional governance principles.

## High Priority Risks

### 1. Technical Complexity Risk
**Risk Level**: High  
**Description**: {project_info.get('architecture', 'Selected architecture')} may introduce complexity beyond team capabilities  
**Impact**: Project delays, quality issues, increased maintenance burden  
**Probability**: Medium  

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Start with simplified architecture (Constitutional Article VII: Simplicity)
- Implement constitutional quality gates at each phase
- Regular architecture reviews and refactoring opportunities
- Team training and knowledge sharing sessions

**Constitutional Alignment**: Article VII (Simplicity) mandates starting simple and adding complexity only when justified.

**Risk Level**: High  
**Description**: {project_info.get('timeline', 'Project timeline')} may be insufficient for quality delivery  
**Impact**: Compromised quality, technical debt, failed deliverables  
**Probability**: Medium  

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement test-first development (Article VIII) to prevent quality issues
- Use constitutional validation gates to maintain standards
- Plan MVP with essential features first

### Success Metrics for Risk Management
- Risk mitigation effectiveness > 80%
- Critical risks prevented from materializing
- Project quality gates consistently passed
- Stakeholder satisfaction maintained throughout project

## Constitutional Compliance in Risk Management

### Article III Compliance
All risk mitigation strategies must pass constitutional validation:
- Testable and measurable mitigation actions

## File Naming Conventions

### General Principles
- Use lowercase with hyphens for directories: `user-management/`
- Use camelCase for JavaScript/TypeScript files: `userService.js`
- Use snake_case for Python files: `user_service.py`  
- Use PascalCase for React components: `UserProfile.jsx`
- Use UPPERCASE for configuration files: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`

### Constitutional Alignment
- **Article VII (Simplicity)**: File structure avoids unnecessary nesting
- **Article IV (Specification-Driven)**: Clear separation between specs and implementation
- **Article VIII (Test-First)**: Tests co-located with implementation files
- **Article V (Agent Coordination)**: Clear boundaries for multi-agent collaboration

## Special Considerations

{f"### Project-Specific Considerations: {project_info.get('special_considerations')}" if project_info.get('special_considerations') else "### No Special Considerations Noted"}

## Clarification Resolution Process

### For High Priority Items:
1. **Schedule stakeholder meetings** within 3-5 business days
2. **Document detailed requirements** with acceptance criteria  
3. **Update constitutional memory** with clarified requirements
4. **Proceed to Step 2** only after high priority items are resolved

### For Medium Priority Items:
1. **Address during Step 2 planning** as part of SPARC methodology
2. **Create research tasks** in Step 2 implementation planning
3. **Include in constitutional validation gates** for Step 2

### For Low Priority Items:  
1. **Document assumptions** for initial implementation
2. **Plan for iteration** in later development phases
3. **Include in technical debt tracking** for future refinement

## Constitutional Compliance Notes

### Article IV: Specification-Driven Implementation
These clarifications ensure that implementation will be driven by complete, executable specifications rather than assumptions.

### Article III: Constitutional Compliance  
All clarifications must be resolved with testable, unambiguous specifications before implementation begins.

### Article IX: Continuous Validation
Clarification resolution will be validated through constitutional gates in Step 2 planning.

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Before Step 2):
- [ ] Schedule clarification meetings with stakeholders  
- [ ] Prioritize high-priority clarifications for resolution
- [ ] Update project memory with clarified requirements

### Step 2 Integration:
- [ ] Incorporate clarified requirements into SPARC methodology
- [ ] Validate technical approach against clarified requirements  
- [ ] Update constitutional validation gates with specific criteria

### Ongoing:
- [ ] Track clarification resolution in project memory
- [ ] Update constitutional memory with patterns for future projects
- [ ] Monitor for new clarifications during implementation
