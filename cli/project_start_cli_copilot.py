- Article IV: Specification-driven development (requirements lead implementation)
- Article V: Agent coordination with clear roles and boundaries
- Article VII: Simplicity principle (avoid over-engineering)
- Article VIII: Test-first development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Generation Context:**
- Document Type: {document_type}
- Project Context: Fully integrated
- Constitutional Framework: Applied
- Technology Stack: Analyzed
- Architecture: Considered

---

**Note:** This is a demonstration of the Copilot integration framework. In the full implementation, this content would be intelligently generated by GitHub Copilot based on the rich project context and constitutional framework principles.

The actual implementation would:
1. Use the project information to create tailored content
2. Apply constitutional framework principles
3. Generate technology-specific recommendations
4. Create actionable, testable specifications
5. Ensure alignment with team size and coordination approach

**Prompt Used for Generation:**

**Note:** This constitutional validation document demonstrates the integration framework. In the full implementation, this would be intelligently generated by GitHub Copilot based on:

1. Project-specific constitutional compliance requirements
2. Technology stack alignment with constitutional principles
3. Intelligent validation of specification completeness
4. Context-aware compliance checking

## Pre-Generation Validation ✓

- [x] **Project description is clear and unambiguous**  
  Description: "{project_info['description']}"
  
- [x] **User needs are identified and articulated**  
  Target audience: {project_info.get('target_audience', 'Identified in project context')}
  
- [x] **Success criteria are measurable and time-bound**  
  Success metrics: {project_info.get('success_metrics', 'To be refined in implementation planning')}

## Copilot Integration Status ✓

- [x] **All four documents generated with Copilot integration**
  - BACKLOG.md: ✅ Generated with intelligent prompting
  - IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md: ✅ Generated with context-aware content
  - RISK_ASSESSMENT.md: ✅ Generated with project-specific risks

🤖 **Generated with Copilot Integration**

## Copilot Integration Status

**Note:** This clarification document demonstrates the integration framework. In the full implementation, this would be intelligently generated by GitHub Copilot to:

1. Analyze project information for gaps and ambiguities
2. Generate context-specific clarification questions
3. Prioritize clarifications based on impact to implementation
4. Create actionable clarification resolution processes

## Technology Stack Analysis
- Selected Stack: {project_info.get('tech_stack', 'Not specified')} 
- Architecture Style: {project_info.get('architecture', 'Not specified')}
- Team Coordination: {project_info.get('agent_coordination', 'Not specified')}

## AI-Identified Clarification Areas

**Note:** In the full Copilot implementation, these would be intelligently identified based on project type analysis, technology stack requirements, business context gaps, and implementation readiness assessment.

### High Priority (AI-Identified)
1. **User Personas**: Current description "{project_info.get('target_audience', 'Not specified')}" needs detailed development
2. **Performance Requirements**: Technology stack requires specific performance targets for architecture decisions
3. **Integration Points**: Business context suggests external system integration needs analysis

## Copilot Integration Benefits

✅ **Intelligent Gap Analysis**: AI identifies missing critical information
✅ **Context-Aware Questions**: Questions tailored to technology stack and architecture  
✅ **Prioritized Clarifications**: AI determines impact on implementation success
✅ **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific steps for resolution
