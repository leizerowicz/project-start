# VS Code AI Integration Guide

## Overview

The Project-Start CLI now provides enhanced VS Code integration with multi-AI assistant support following the GitHub Spec-Kit pattern. This integration offers seamless development experience with intelligent document generation.

## AI Assistant Integration

### GitHub Copilot (Recommended for VS Code)
When running in VS Code with Copilot enabled:
- **Native Integration**: Direct Copilot integration for document enhancement
- **Prompt Files**: Creates temporary files with rich context for Copilot processing
- **Enhanced Templates**: Copilot-ready templates for intelligent expansion
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatic VS Code environment detection

### Multi-AI Support
The CLI supports multiple AI assistants:
- **GitHub Copilot**: Default choice for VS Code users
- **Claude Code**: Alternative AI assistant option
- **Gemini CLI**: Google AI integration
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Smart templates when AI unavailable

## Environment Detection

### Automatic VS Code Detection
The CLI automatically detects VS Code environment through:
```bash
VSCODE_PID=12345        # Set automatically by VS Code
TERM_PROGRAM=vscode     # Terminal program identifier
PROJECT_START_VSCODE=true  # Manual override flag
```

### Enhanced Integration Features
When VS Code is detected:
- ✅ **Enhanced AI Integration**: Better Copilot integration support
- ✅ **Prompt File Generation**: Rich context files for AI enhancement
- ✅ **Template Optimization**: VS Code-optimized document templates
- ✅ **Environment Feedback**: Clear status about integration capabilities

## Features

### 🎯 Automatic Project Detection
- **Smart Root Detection**: Automatically detects project root when running from VS Code

- Markdown preview settings
- File associations and exclusions
- Project-Start specific settings

### `.vscode/tasks.json`
- All CLI commands as VS Code tasks
- Proper terminal integration
- Project root auto-detection
- Build group organization

### `.vscode/extensions.json`
- Recommended extensions for optimal experience
- GitHub Copilot integration
- Python development tools
- Markdown and documentation tools

### `.vscode/launch.json`
- Debug configurations for CLI commands
- Environment variable setup
- VS Code environment detection

### `project-start.code-workspace`
- Multi-folder workspace configuration
- Organized folder structure
- Workspace-specific settings
- Quick-start task definitions

## Best Practices

### 🎯 Getting Started
1. Open the workspace file: `project-start.code-workspace`
2. Install recommended extensions when prompted
3. Use Command Palette for task access
4. Let VS Code auto-detect project paths

### 🔧 Daily Usage
- Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" for CLI access
- File navigation through VS Code sidebar
- Terminal integration for interactive CLI operations
- Debug mode for troubleshooting

### 🚀 Advanced Features
- Multi-folder workspace for complex projects
- Task dependencies and automation
- Integrated debugging with breakpoints
- Extension ecosystem for enhanced development

## Troubleshooting

### Environment Detection Issues
If VS Code integration is not detected:
1. Ensure you're running tasks from VS Code (not external terminal)
2. Check that `.vscode/` configuration files exist
3. Verify workspace file is properly configured
4. Set `PROJECT_START_VSCODE=true` environment variable if needed

### Task Execution Issues
If tasks fail to run:
1. Verify Python 3 is available in PATH
2. Check that you're in the correct workspace root
3. Ensure CLI file permissions are correct
4. Run `python3 cli/project_start_cli.py --help` to verify CLI accessibility

### Path Detection Issues
If project paths are incorrect:
1. Verify workspace is opened at project root
2. Check for `.vscode/settings.json` in project root
3. Ensure workspace file is in correct location
4. Use absolute paths in VS Code terminal if needed

## CLI Commands from VS Code

All original CLI functionality remains available. When running from VS Code:

```bash
# These commands now auto-detect VS Code environment
python3 cli/project_start_cli.py /project-start-enhanced
python3 cli/project_start_cli.py /enhance-step-1
python3 cli/project_start_cli.py /enhance-step-1 --existing-project

# Project paths are automatically detected - no need for --project-path
python3 cli/project_start_cli.py /enhance-step-2
python3 cli/project_start_cli.py /enhance-step-3
python3 cli/project_start_cli.py /enhance-step-4
```

## What's Preserved

✅ **All existing functionality maintained**
✅ **Backward compatibility with command-line usage**  
✅ **No changes to core CLI behavior**
✅ **Constitutional compliance and validation preserved**
✅ **Memory systems and agent coordination unchanged**
✅ **All Step 1-4 workflows fully functional**

The VS Code integration is purely additive - it enhances the experience without modifying any existing capabilities.
