## Project Context
{
  "name": "Test complete workflow with autonomous copilot instructions",
  "description": "Test complete workflow with autonomous copilot instructions",
  "tech_stack": "Python (FastAPI) + React + PostgreSQL",
  "architecture": "Monolithic (single deployable unit)",
  "development_approach": "Agile/Scrum (iterative development)",
  "team_size": "1-3",
  "agent_coordination": "Standard (2-3 specialized agents with clear roles)",
  "testing_strategy": "Unit + Integration + E2E tests"
}

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Technology Stack**: Python (FastAPI) + React + PostgreSQL
2. **Architecture**: Monolithic (single deployable unit)
3. **Development Approach**: Agile/Scrum (iterative development)
4. **Agent Coordination**: Standard (2-3 specialized agents with clear roles)

## Constitutional Compliance Status
- Article I (Workflow-First): ✓ Following Step 1→2→3→4 progression
- Article III (Constitutional Compliance): ✓ Quality gates established
- Article IV (Specification-Driven): ✓ Specifications generated
- Article VII (Simplicity): ✓ Simple-first approach documented
- Article VIII (Test-First): ✓ Testing strategy planned
- Article IX (Continuous Validation): ✓ Validation gates active

## Context for Future Agents
This project has completed Step 1 discovery with comprehensive specification generation.
All constitutional validation gates have been passed. The project is ready for Step 2
constitutional SPARC methodology implementation.

Key context agents should know:
- Interactive questionnaire captured comprehensive project requirements
- All Step 1 documents generated with constitutional compliance
- Clarifications needed document identifies areas requiring stakeholder input
- Memory systems initialized for persistent context throughout project lifecycle
