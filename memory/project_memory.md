## Constitutional Compliance Status
- Article I (Workflow-First): ✓ Following Step 1→2→3→4 progression
- Article III (Constitutional Compliance): ✓ Quality gates established
- Article IV (Specification-Driven): ✓ Specifications generated
- Article VII (Simplicity): ✓ Simple-first approach documented
- Article VIII (Test-First): ✓ Testing strategy planned
- Article IX (Continuous Validation): ✓ Validation gates active

## Context for Future Agents
This project has completed Step 1 discovery with comprehensive specification generation.
All constitutional validation gates have been passed. The project is ready for Step 2
constitutional SPARC methodology implementation.

Key context agents should know:
- Interactive questionnaire captured comprehensive project requirements
- All Step 1 documents generated with constitutional compliance
- Clarifications needed document identifies areas requiring stakeholder input
- Memory systems initialized for persistent context throughout project lifecycle
